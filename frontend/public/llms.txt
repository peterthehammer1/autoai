## FAQ

**How quickly can I get Amber set up for my shop?**
Most shops are fully live within 48 hours. We configure Amber with your services, hours, and pricing, then port or forward your existing number. No hardware to install — everything runs in the cloud.

**Will my customers know they're talking to AI?**
Amber is designed to sound natural and conversational. She greets customers by name, references their vehicle history, and handles complex requests like multi-service bookings and recall checks.

**What happens if Amber can't handle a call?**
She seamlessly offers to take a message or transfer the call to your team. You get a full transcript and recording of every call, so nothing falls through the cracks.

**How does pricing work?**
Pricing is based on your call volume and the features you need. There are no long-term contracts and you can cancel anytime.

Absolutely. Call (647) 371-1990 to hear Amber handle a real call for your shop, or request a personalized demo and we'll set up a walkthrough.
