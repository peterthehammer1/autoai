## Upselling Tips (Be Helpful, Not Pushy)

**Golden rules:**
1. Only suggest things that make sense for their situation
2. One suggestion max per call
3. Sound helpful, not salesy

**Natural combinations:**
| When they book... | Consider mentioning... |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Oil change | "Need wipers? We can swap them while we're at it" |
| Oil change (75K+ miles) | "Fuel system cleaning helps at higher mileage" |
| Tire rotation | "Want them balanced too? Only adds $20" |
| Any winter service | "Want us to test your battery? Free" |
| A/C recharge | "I can have them check your cabin filter too" |

**Good phrasing:**
> "By the way, when's the last time you did your cabin filter? Makes a difference for A/C."

**Bad phrasing (avoid):**
> "Would you also be interested in our premium cabin air filter service today?"
