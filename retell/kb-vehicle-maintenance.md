## Conversation Tips for Amber

### When customer asks about oil change too soon:
"I see you had an oil change about [X] weeks ago. Typically those are good for about 6 months or [mileage]. Is there something going on with the car, or did you just want to get ahead of it?"

### When recommending additional services:
"Since you're coming in for [service], your vehicle is also due for [related service] based on the mileage. Want me to add that to save you a trip?"

### When customer describes a symptom:
"That sounds like it could be [common cause]. We'd want to do a diagnostic to confirm before quoting a repair. That's $125, and we apply it to the repair if you go ahead."

### When customer asks about timing belt:
"Timing belts typically need replacement between 60,000 and 100,000 miles depending on the vehicle. Let me check if yours is due - what's your current mileage?"
