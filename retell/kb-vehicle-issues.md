## Dashboard Lights

### Check Engine Light (MIL - Malfunction Indicator Lamp)

**What callers might say:** "My check engine light is on" / "The engine light came on" / "There's a yellow light that looks like an engine" / "The service engine soon light"

**What it usually means:**
- **Most common:** Loose or faulty gas cap (easy fix), oxygen sensor, catalytic converter issue, or ignition/spark plug problem.
- Can also be: Mass airflow sensor, EVAP leak, thermostat, or other emissions/engine sensors.
- **We can't know the exact cause without reading the code** - that's what the diagnostic does.

**Urgency:**
- **Solid (not flashing):** Usually okay to drive to the shop. Avoid long trips or heavy load until checked.
- **Flashing:** More serious - could be misfire or catalyst damage. Advise them to avoid driving if possible and get it in soon.

**Service to schedule:** **Check Engine Light Diagnosis** (we read the code and tell them exactly what's wrong; fee applies to repair if they approve).

**What to say:**
> "That light can mean a few different things - could be something simple like a loose gas cap, or a sensor. We need to read the code to know for sure. We do a diagnostic for $125, and if you go ahead with the repair we apply that to your total. Is the light steady or flashing?"

---

### Oil Pressure / Oil Can Light

**What callers might say:** "The oil light came on" / "Red oil can light" / "Low oil pressure warning"

**What it usually means:**
- **Low oil level** (most common) - needs oil top-up or oil change.
- **Oil pressure problem** - leak, worn engine, or oil pump (less common but serious).

**Urgency:** **High.** Tell them to **stop driving** if the light is on while the engine is running. Low oil can cause engine damage quickly.

**Service to schedule:** If they say the light "came on briefly" or "flashes at startup," suggest **oil change** (Conventional, Synthetic Blend, or Full Synthetic depending on what they use). If the light **stays on**, say: "I'd get it in as soon as you can - don't drive it far. We'll check the oil level and pressure and go from there."

**What to say:**
> "That's one you don't want to ignore - usually it means low oil. If it's on right now, I'd avoid driving it and get it in today. We can check the level and top it off or do an oil change. When can you bring it by?"

---

### Battery / Charging Light

**What callers might say:** "Battery light is on" / "Red battery symbol" / "Charging system warning"

**What it usually means:**
- **Alternator not charging** (most common) - battery will go dead.
- Loose or corroded battery cables.
- Failing battery (less often the cause of the light, but we test it).

**Urgency:** **Medium–high.** Car may run for a short while then die. Avoid turning the engine off in a bad spot; get it to the shop or home, then we can test.

**Service to schedule:** **Battery Test** (free) first. Then likely **Alternator Replacement** or **Battery Replacement** depending on what we find.

**What to say:**
> "That usually means the alternator isn't charging the battery - so the battery will eventually die. You might have a little time to get it here. We'll do a free battery test and check the charging system. When can you get it in?"

---

### Brake Warning Light

**What callers might say:** "Brake light is on" / "Red brake symbol on the dash" / "Parking brake light won't go off"

**What it usually means:**
- **Parking brake still on** (first thing to ask).
- **Low brake fluid** - could mean worn pads (fluid drops as pads wear) or a leak.
- **Brake system problem** - needs inspection.

**Urgency:** **High if they're driving.** Don't assume it's just the parking brake; get it checked.

**Service to schedule:** **Brake Inspection** (free). We check pads, fluid, and lines and tell them what's needed.

**What to say:**
> "First thing - is the parking brake fully released? If it is and the light's still on, we should take a look. Our brake inspection is free - we'll check the fluid, pads, and lines. When can you bring it in?"

---

### ABS Light

**What callers might say:** "ABS light is on" / "Anti-lock brake light" / "Yellow ABS symbol"

**What it usually means:**
- **ABS wheel speed sensor** (common) - dirty, damaged, or failed.
- **ABS module or wiring** - less common.
- Normal brakes still work; **ABS (anti-lock)** may not work in a panic stop.

**Urgency:** **Medium.** Brakes still work; ABS might not. Advise them to drive carefully and get it checked.

**Service to schedule:** **Brake Inspection** (free) and/or **ABS Sensor Replacement** after we diagnose.

**What to say:**
> "Your regular brakes still work - it's the anti-lock system that might not. We can take a look; often it's a wheel speed sensor. We'll do a brake inspection and go from there. When works for you?"

---

### Coolant / Temperature Warning (Red Thermometer or "Hot")

**What callers might say:** "Temperature light is on" / "Car's overheating" / "Red thermometer" / "Coolant warning"

**What it usually means:**
- **Low coolant** - leak or evaporation.
- **Thermostat stuck closed** - engine overheats.
- **Water pump** not circulating.
- **Radiator** or hose leak.

**Urgency:** **High.** Overheating can damage the engine. Tell them to **pull over safely, turn off the engine**, and not drive until it's checked.

**Service to schedule:** **Coolant Flush** (if just low/old coolant), or **Thermostat Replacement**, **Water Pump Replacement**, or **Radiator Replacement** / **Radiator Hose Replacement** after we inspect.

**What to say:**
> "I wouldn't drive it with that light on - overheating can damage the engine. Pull over somewhere safe and let it cool down. We need to see it to know if it's low coolant, a leak, or something like the thermostat or water pump. When can you get it towed or brought in?"

---

### Tire Pressure (TPMS) Light

**What callers might say:** "Tire light is on" / "TPMS light" / "Low tire pressure warning"

**What it usually means:**
- **Low tire pressure** (most common) - check and inflate to spec.
- **TPMS sensor** dead or damaged (after checking pressure).
- **Seasonal** - pressure drops in cold weather.

**Urgency:** **Low–medium.** Low pressure hurts fuel economy and tire life; very low can be unsafe at speed.

**Service to schedule:** If they just need air: "You can often top up the tires at a gas station and the light may go out. If it stays on or comes back, we can check pressures and the sensors." If they want us to do it: **Tire Rotation** or **Multi-Point Inspection** (we check tires and pressures).

**What to say:**
> "Usually that means one or more tires are low. If you can check the pressure and fill them to what's on the door sticker, the light might go off. If it keeps coming back or you're not sure, bring it in and we'll check the pressures and the sensors."

---

### Airbag / SRS Light

**What callers might say:** "Airbag light is on" / "SRS light" / "Red person with balloon"

**What it usually means:**
- **Fault in airbag system** - sensor, wiring, or module.
- **Recall** on some vehicles - dealer handles recalls.
- Airbags may not deploy in a crash until it's fixed.

**Urgency:** **Medium.** Car is drivable; safety system may not work.

**Service to schedule:** **Check Engine Light Diagnosis** or **Multi-Point Inspection** - we can scan for SRS codes. Some airbag work is dealer-only; we can advise after we read the code.

**What to say:**
> "That means the airbag system has a fault - we'd want to get it looked at so they're there if you need them. We can scan it and see what's going on; sometimes it's a sensor, sometimes it has to go to the dealer. When can you bring it in?"

---

### Power Steering Light (Electric or Fluid)

**What callers might say:** "Power steering light" / "Steering is heavy" / "Steering warning"

**What it usually means:**
- **Low power steering fluid** (if hydraulic) - leak or low level.
- **Electric power steering** fault - sensor or motor.
- **Power steering pump** failing (hydraulic).

**Urgency:** **Medium.** Steering may be stiff; driving at low speed is harder.

**Service to schedule:** **Power Steering Flush** (fluid service) or pump/rack repair after we inspect.

**What to say:**
> "We can check the fluid level and the system. If it's low, we top it off and look for leaks. If it's electric steering, we'll scan it and see what the fault is. When can you get it in?"

---

### Transmission Temperature / Warning

**What callers might say:** "Transmission light" / "Trans temp light" / "Transmission overheating"

**What it usually means:**
- **Overheating transmission** - low fluid, heavy use, or cooling issue.
- **Transmission fault** - may need fluid service or repair.

**Urgency:** **High.** Driving with an overheated transmission can damage it.

**Service to schedule:** **Transmission Fluid Exchange** (if fluid is old/low) or transmission diagnostic if there's a fault code.

**What to say:**
> "I wouldn't drive it hard with that light on. We'll check the fluid level and condition. Often a transmission fluid exchange helps; if there's a fault code we'll see what's going on. When can you bring it in?"

---

### Service / Maintenance Reminder (Wrench or "Service Soon")

**What callers might say:** "Service light came on" / "Wrench icon" / "Maintenance required"

**What it usually means:**
- **Oil change due** (very common).
- **Scheduled maintenance** - 30,000 KM, 60,000 KM, 90,000 KM service, etc.
- Set by mileage or time; we reset it after service.

**Urgency:** **Low–medium.** Schedule when convenient.

**Service to schedule:** **Oil change** (Conventional, Synthetic Blend, or Full Synthetic) and/or **30,000 / 60,000 / 90,000 KM Service** depending on mileage.

**What to say:**
> "That's usually the car telling you it's due for an oil change or scheduled service. What's your mileage? We can get you in for an oil change and multi-point check and reset the light. When works for you?"

---

### Traction Control / Stability Control Light

**What callers might say:** "Traction control light" / "TCS or ESC light on"

**What it usually means:**
- **Turned off manually** (button) - they can turn it back on.
- **Wheel speed sensor** (shared with ABS) - same as ABS issue.
- **Stability system fault** - needs scan.

**Urgency:** **Low–medium.** Car drives normally; traction/stability aid may not work in slippery conditions.

**Service to schedule:** Same as **ABS** - **Brake Inspection** and possibly **ABS Sensor Replacement** after we check.

**What to say:**
> "If you didn't turn it off with the button, we should scan it - often it's related to the same sensors as the ABS. We can take a look when you bring it in. When works?"

---

## Common Symptoms (No Light, But Problem)

### "Car won't start" / "Nothing happens when I turn the key"

**Likely causes:** Dead battery, bad starter, or poor connection.

**Service to schedule:** **Battery Test** (free), then **Battery Replacement** or **Starter Replacement** as needed.

**What to say:**
> "We'll start with a free battery test. If the battery's good, it could be the starter. When can you get it here - do you need a jump to get it in?"

---

### "Grinding / squealing when I brake"

**Likely causes:** Worn brake pads (metal on metal), or rust/dirt on rotors.

**Service to schedule:** **Brake Inspection** (free). Then **Front Brake Pads**, **Rear Brake Pads**, **Front Brake Pads & Rotors**, or **Rear Brake Pads & Rotors** as needed.

**What to say:**
> "That's often the brake pads worn down. We do a free brake inspection and will tell you exactly what you need. I wouldn't wait too long - when can you bring it in?"

---

### "Loud exhaust / rumbling / smell like gas underneath"

**Likely causes:** Exhaust leak, hole in muffler, or leak before the catalytic converter.

**Service to schedule:** **Exhaust Inspection** (free). Then **Muffler Replacement**, **Exhaust Pipe Repair**, or **Catalytic Converter Replacement** as needed.

**What to say:**
> "We'll take a look underneath - our exhaust inspection is free. Could be a leak or the muffler. When can you get it in?"

---

### "A/C not cold" / "Blowing hot air"

**Likely causes:** Low refrigerant (leak or need recharge), A/C compressor, or condenser issue.

**Service to schedule:** **A/C Performance Check** and/or **A/C Recharge**. If leak or major fault: **A/C Leak Detection**, **A/C Compressor Replacement**, or **A/C Condenser Replacement**.

**What to say:**
> "Usually it's low refrigerant - we can check the system and recharge it if needed. If there's a bigger issue we'll let you know. When would you like to bring it in?"

---

### "Car pulls to one side" / "Steering wheel crooked when driving straight"

**Likely causes:** Low tire pressure, bad alignment, or worn suspension/steering.

**Service to schedule:** **Wheel Alignment - 4 Wheel**. If suspension: **Suspension Inspection**, **Front Strut Replacement**, **Control Arm Replacement**, etc.

**What to say:**
> "We'll check tire pressures and the alignment. Often an alignment fixes it - we can get you scheduled for that. When works?"

---

### "Rough idle" / "Engine shaking" / "Stalling"

**Likely causes:** Spark plugs, ignition coil, vacuum leak, or fuel issue. Check engine light may be on.

**Service to schedule:** **Check Engine Light Diagnosis** first. Then often **Spark Plug Replacement**, **Ignition Coil Replacement**, or **Fuel System Cleaning** depending on code and mileage.

**What to say:**
> "We need to see what the engine is doing - do you have a check engine light on? We'll run a diagnostic and go from there. When can you bring it in?"

---

### "Smell coolant" / "Sweet smell" / "Steam under the hood"

**Likely causes:** Coolant leak - hose, radiator, water pump, or heater core.

**Service to schedule:** **Coolant Flush** and inspection; then **Radiator Hose Replacement**, **Radiator Replacement**, **Water Pump Replacement**, or **Heater Core Replacement** as needed.

**What to say:**
> "That sounds like a coolant leak. Don't drive it if the temp gauge goes up. We'll find the leak and give you options. When can you get it here?"

---

### "Clicking when I turn" (front end)

**Likely causes:** **CV axle / CV joint** (common), or sometimes wheel bearing.

**Service to schedule:** **CV Axle Replacement** (we have this in Steering & Suspension) or **Wheel Bearing Replacement** after we check.

**What to say:**
> "That's often a CV joint on the front axle - we can take a look and get it fixed. When can you bring it in?"

---

### "Battery keeps dying" / "Needs a jump every few days"

**Likely causes:** Old battery, alternator not charging, or parasitic draw.

**Service to schedule:** **Battery Test** (free), then **Battery Replacement** or **Alternator Replacement** as needed.

**What to say:**
