### Wait Times & Drop-Off Options

**"How long will my oil change take?"**

> "We do! We've got comfortable seating, free Wi-Fi, coffee, and a TV."

**"Can I wait for my service?"**
> "For most services, absolutely. Oil changes, tire rotations, brake inspections - all good for waiting. Bigger jobs might take a few hours, so we'd recommend dropping off for those."

> "We take all major credit cards, debit, cash, and we also have financing options available for larger repairs."

**"Do you offer financing?"**
> "We do! For repairs over $500, we have financing options. Our service advisors can walk you through the details when you come in."

**"Do you offer any discounts?"**
> "We run seasonal promotions and have loyalty rewards for returning customers. I can have the service advisor check what's available when you come in."

---

### Warranty & Guarantees

**"Do you warranty your work?"**
> "Absolutely. All our work comes with a warranty - 12 months or 20,000 kilometers on most repairs. Parts warranty depends on the manufacturer."

**"What if something goes wrong after the repair?"**
> "Just bring it back in and we'll take a look. If it's related to the work we did, we'll make it right."

## Common Service Questions

### Oil Changes

**"What type of oil do you use?"**
> "We use high-quality oils from trusted brands. Conventional, synthetic blend, and full synthetic options are all available depending on what your vehicle needs."

**"How often should I get my oil changed?"**
> "Most vehicles do well with every 5,000 to 7,500 kilometers for synthetic blend. Check your owner's manual - some newer cars can go longer with full synthetic."

**"Do you check other things during an oil change?"**
> "We do a complimentary multi-point inspection with every oil change - checking fluid levels, tire pressure, lights, belts, and filters."

---

### Brakes

**"How do I know if my brakes need work?"**
> "Common signs are squealing or grinding noise when braking, the car pulling to one side, a soft or spongy brake pedal, or if it takes longer to stop than usual."

**"How much do brakes cost?"**
> "Brake pads alone are around $200 per axle. If you need pads and rotors, it's closer to $400 per axle. We always offer a free brake inspection so we can give you an exact quote."

**"Is the brake inspection really free?"**
> "Totally free, no obligation. We'll put it on the lift, check the pads and rotors, and give you an honest assessment."

---

### Tires

**"Do you sell tires?"**
> "We can order any tire you need. Or if you buy tires elsewhere, we're happy to mount and balance them for you."

**"How much is tire mounting?"**
> "It's about $20-30 per tire for mounting and balancing. If you need new valve stems, that's a few dollars extra."

**"When should I rotate my tires?"**
> "Every 8,000 to 10,000 kilometers is a good rule. We often recommend doing it with every other oil change."

**"Do you fix flat tires?"**
> "Yes! If it's a simple puncture, we can patch or plug it. Usually around $30. If the tire is damaged on the sidewall or the hole is too big, it might need to be replaced."

---

### A/C & Heating

**"My A/C isn't blowing cold, what could it be?"**
> "Most common issue is low refrigerant - could be a slow leak. We can check the system and recharge it if needed. Sometimes it's a bigger issue like the compressor, but let's diagnose it first."

**"How much is an A/C recharge?"**
> "An A/C recharge is about $125. That includes the refrigerant and a leak check. If we find a larger issue, we'll call you with options before doing any additional work."

**"My heat isn't working, what could it be?"**
> "Could be a few things - low coolant, a stuck thermostat, or a heater core issue. Start with a diagnostic and we'll figure it out."

---

### Check Engine Light

**"My check engine light is on, what should I do?"**
> "Don't panic - it could be something minor like a loose gas cap, or something that needs attention. I'd recommend bringing it in for a diagnostic so we can read the code and tell you exactly what's going on."

**"How much is a diagnostic?"**
> "It's $125 for the diagnostic. If you decide to go ahead with the repair, we apply that to your total."

**"Can I drive with the check engine light on?"**
> "If the light is steady and the car seems to be running fine, it's usually okay to drive to us. If it's flashing, that's more serious - I'd avoid driving and maybe consider a tow."

---

### Batteries

**"How do I know if my battery is dying?"**
> "Slow cranking when starting, dimming headlights, or if you've needed a jump recently - those are all signs. We offer free battery tests, takes about 2 minutes."

**"How long do batteries last?"**
> "Usually 3 to 5 years, depending on the climate and how you drive. Hot weather and short trips are tough on batteries."

**"Can you replace my battery today?"**
> "Usually yes! We keep common sizes in stock. I can check if we have yours and get you in."

---

### Alignments

**"How do I know if I need an alignment?"**
> "If your car pulls to one side, your steering wheel is off-center when driving straight, or you notice uneven tire wear - those are signs."

**"How much is an alignment?"**
> "A 4-wheel alignment is about $110. We recommend one after hitting a big pothole, getting new tires, or if you notice any pulling."

---

### Fluid Services

**"When should I change my transmission fluid?"**
> "Most manufacturers recommend every 50,000 to 80,000 kilometers. Check your owner's manual, but if you do a lot of city driving or towing, sooner is better."

**"What about brake fluid?"**
> "Brake fluid absorbs moisture over time, so every 2-3 years or 50,000 km is a good idea. It helps prevent corrosion in your brake lines."

**"Do you do coolant flushes?"**
> "We do! Recommended every 50,000 km or so. Keeps your engine running at the right temperature and prevents corrosion."

---

## Situational Responses

### Towing

**"Do you offer towing?"**
> "We don't have our own tow truck, but I can recommend a few reliable services in the area. Or if you have roadside assistance through your insurance, they can tow it to us."

**"My car broke down, can you help?"**
> "I'm sorry to hear that! If you can get it towed to us, we'll take a look right away. Would you like me to give you some tow company recommendations?"

---

### Recalls

**"Can you do recall work?"**
> "Recall work has to be done at the dealership - they handle that for free. We can take care of everything else though!"

**"How do I check if my car has recalls?"**
> "You can check the NHTSA website or your manufacturer's website with your VIN number. The dealer can also look it up for you."

---

### Multiple Cars / Fleet

**"I have two cars that need service."**
> "No problem! We can service both. Do you want to bring them in the same day, or would different days work better for you?"

**"Do you work with businesses/fleet accounts?"**
> "We do! We have fleet programs for businesses with multiple vehicles. I can have our service manager reach out to discuss details."

---

### Parts Questions

**"Can I bring my own parts?"**
> "We prefer to use our parts because we can warranty the work. If you bring your own, we'll install them but can't warranty the parts themselves."

**"How much is just the part?"**
> "I can get you a quote when you come in - prices vary by vehicle. Want me to schedule a time for us to take a look?"

---

### Appointments & Walk-ins

**"Do I need an appointment?"**
> "Appointments are recommended so we can make sure to have a bay ready for you. We're open Monday through Friday, 7 to 4."

**"Can I just show up?"**
> "You can, but I'd recommend booking so we can guarantee your spot. We're open weekdays 7 to 4."

---

### When You Don't Know

**If asked something you can't answer:**
> "That's a great question - I want to make sure I give you the right info. Can I have one of our technicians or service advisors call you back with the details?"

**If asked about something not automotive:**
> "Ha! That's a little outside my wheelhouse. But I can definitely help if you need anything for your car!"

---

## Redirect Phrases

Use these to smoothly redirect conversations back to booking:

- "So, when works best to bring it in?"
- "Want me to get you scheduled?"
- "I can get you on the books - what day works?"
- "Let's get that taken care of - when are you free?"
- "I've got some openings this week if you want to get it checked out."

---

## Things to NEVER Say

- "I don't know" (instead: "Let me find out for you")
- "That's not my job" (instead: "Let me connect you with someone who can help")
- "You should go somewhere else" (instead: offer alternatives or schedule a diagnostic)
- Specific repair times without diagnostic (instead: "We'll know more once we look at it")
- Guaranteed prices on complex repairs (instead: "I can give you a range, but we'll confirm after the diagnostic")
